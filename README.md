# ToDo It

## Background

ToDo It is a very simple to-do list web app that I used to try out:

- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/)

My goal was to demonstrate the basics of reactivity in Vue, as well as how a backend like Convex pairs really nicely with it, especially in terms of keeping data in sync. Vuetify offers some nice component-based styling, that is quite convenient and really speeds up development.

## Future Work

It would be nice to add authentication as a next step - currently all tasks are visible to and editable by everyyone. Since this was just a demo/practice project, authentication wasn't a hard requirement, but going forward, I think it would be a good feature to have.
